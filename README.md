# Sample-Robotics-Code
This code is written in C++ and uses the natural language of the programming software designed for Vex Robotics, called Vex Code.
The code itself includes several algorithms, including a fine-tuned acceleration algorithm, and other movement features (void move).
It also includes what we call is integer programming,
By setting the controller buttons to type in different integers, we are able to make the robot move in a variety of ways easily.
In this specific code, we have 8 different integer codes which can be used by the driver to make the robot perform specific functions.
This code was made for the 2018-2019 Vex Robotics season, called Turning Point.
Due to our programming, we were able to finish 5th in our division in the World Championship!
